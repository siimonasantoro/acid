## Overview

The AutoCorrelation Integral Drill (ACID) Test Set provides a systematic approach to analyzing autocorrelation functions in datasets. This tool is essential for researchers and data scientists working with time series data. The ACID Test Set helps validate and assess the properties of datasets, focusing on features like exponential correlation time and integrated correlation time.

You can download the latest version of the ACID Test Set [here](https://github.com/siimonasantoro/acid/releases). This link leads to the releases section where you can find the necessary files to download and execute.

## Installation

To install the ACID Test Set, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siimonasantoro/acid.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd acid
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the ACID Test Set in your Python projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to get started:

```python
import acid

# Load your dataset
data = acid.load_data('path/to/your/dataset.csv')

# Perform autocorrelation analysis
results = acid.analyze(data)

# Display results
acid.display_results(results)
```

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Data Structure

The ACID Test Set uses a structured format for datasets. Each dataset should be in CSV format and contain the following columns:

- `timestamp`: The time of the observation.
- `value`: The measured value at that timestamp.

Example:

| timestamp           | value |
|---------------------|-------|
| 2023-01-01 00:00:00 | 10    |
| 2023-01-01 01:00:00 | 15    |
| 2023-01-01 02:00:00 | 20    |

Ensure your dataset follows this structure for accurate analysis.

## Topics Covered

The ACID Test Set covers a range of topics essential for time series analysis:

- **ACF (Autocorrelation Function)**: Measures how the value of a variable at one time point relates to its values at previous time points.
- **Autocorrelation Integral**: A method to analyze the correlation of a dataset over time.
- **Dataset**: The collection of data points used for analysis.
- **Exponential Correlation Time**: The time it takes for the correlation to decay exponentially.
- **Integrated Correlation Time**: A measure of the time span over which the correlation remains significant.
- **Power Spectral Distribution (PSD)**: A representation of the power of a signal as a function of frequency.
- **Python**: The programming language used for implementing the ACID Test Set.
- **Stacie, Stepup, Typst**: Tools and methodologies related to systematic validation.
- **Workflow**: The process of analyzing and validating datasets.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to illustrate how to use the ACID Test Set:

### Example 1: Basic Autocorrelation Analysis

```python
import acid

data = acid.load_data('path/to/your/dataset.csv')
results = acid.analyze(data)
acid.display_results(results)
```

### Example 2: Advanced Analysis with Custom Parameters

```python
import acid

data = acid.load_data('path/to/your/dataset.csv')
results = acid.analyze(data, method='integrated', threshold=0.05)
acid.display_results(results)
```
